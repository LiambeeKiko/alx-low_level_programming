### Bit Manipulation Project Learning Objectives:

## Upon completion of this project, you should be able to convey the following without external assistance:

Efficiently locate relevant information sources with minimal guidance.
Proficiently manipulate bits and apply bitwise operators.

## Project Requirements:

Use one of the following text editors: vi, vim, or emacs.
Compile all files on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Compile programs and functions using gcc 4.8.4 with the following flags: -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic.
Ensure all files conclude with a newline character.
Include a mandatory README.md file at the project's root folder.
Adhere to the Betty coding style; verification will be done using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
Avoid the use of global variables.
Limit each file to no more than five functions.
Restrict the use of C standard library functions to malloc, free, and exit; prohibit functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc.
You may use the _putchar function.
There is no need to push the _putchar.c file; it will not be considered.
While main.c files are provided as examples, you may use them for testing purposes but are not required to push them to your repository. Compilation will use custom main.c files, which may differ from the examples.
Include prototypes for all your functions and the _putchar function in a header file named holberton.h.
Don't forget to push your header file.

Ensure all your header files use include guards to prevent multiple inclusions.

## Project Tasks:

Develop a function that converts a binary number into an unsigned int.
Create a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
Implement a function that retrieves the value of a bit at a specified index.
Design a function that sets a bit's value to 1 at a given index.
Develop a function that sets a bit's value to 0 at a specified index.
Create a function that calculates the number of bit flips required to transition from one number to another.
Implement a function to verify endianness.


# In this project, you will gain expertise in bit manipulation and demonstrate strong coding practices while adhering to specific project requirements.
